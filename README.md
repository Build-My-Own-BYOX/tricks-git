# tricks-git
A collection of tricks, debug, lessons that I learn about git through out my adventure (and it's still going)

Tips: Each heading will be divided to certain categories: tricks, troubleshooting, lessons, common "good/bad" pratices.

And, mostly the title of each item would be kept as clean as possible, such that you can google search for the essential info with that title

And (again), this repo focuses on providing quick look, not a wikipedia with long explanation. Hope you enjoy the dessert.
